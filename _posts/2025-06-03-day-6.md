what_i_learned: |
   We started off the day by listing the goals we wanted to achieve, which helped set a clear direction for our work. Once we had our goals in mind, we got started right away. The first task was to load and display images from the dataset, which was a straightforward process. Afterward, we focused on cropping the photos to remove unnecessary information on the pages. The cropping part was key because it allowed us to zoom in on the relevant parts of the images, making the data cleaner for further processing.

  No Blockers.
reflection: |
 Today was a good day overall. We had a longer break from 12:30 to 1:30, which gave me some extra time to relax and recharge. It was nice to have that little pause in the middle of the day. On top of that, I was able to complete all of my tasks on time, which felt great. It really helped with maintaining the flow and momentum. We also took some time to set the goals for tomorrow, which will focus on denoising the images. I’m looking forward to tackling that challenge and hopefully having a smooth day tomorrow.
