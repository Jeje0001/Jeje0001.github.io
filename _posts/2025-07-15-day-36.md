  Today at my internship was a unique blend of self-reflection, collaboration, and academic engagement. Unlike our usual coding or research-intensive routines, the focus shifted to something equally vital: understanding ourselves as individuals and as a team. This shift began with a visit to the business school, where we participated in a session designed to help us identify our team’s strengths and weaknesses. Later, we met with our professor to provide updates on our project progress and receive guidance on our next steps. The session at the business school was an eye-opening experience. Through a series of exercises and discussions, we were encouraged to reflect on our personal working styles, how we contribute to group dynamics, and where our communication or collaboration might need improvement. Using a combination of personality assessments and real-world scenarios, we uncovered key strengths within our group—such as adaptability, creativity, and technical rigor—as well as areas we could strengthen, like time management, conflict resolution, and delegation. This wasn’t just a theoretical exercise; it gave us a clearer picture of how to work more effectively together moving forward.

  Today’s internship experience was different from our usual coding tasks and project work—it was about stepping back and looking inward, both individually and as a team. We spent the morning at the business school, participating in a session focused on uncovering our team’s strengths and weaknesses. It wasn’t something I expected to enjoy as much as I did, but it turned out to be one of the most insightful days so far. Through guided exercises and discussions, I got to see not only how I function within the team but also how each person contributes in their own unique way. It was interesting to realize that some of the things I thought were just personal habits—like preferring structure or avoiding conflict—actually affect how I collaborate with others. I also saw that we have a lot of strengths as a team: we’re resilient, curious, and driven. But we also uncovered real challenges—like communication gaps or the tendency to push through individually instead of leaning on each other when needed.
