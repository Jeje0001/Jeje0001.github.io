  Today, we began working with the newly selected ECG dataset, marking a significant shift in our data strategy. The initial focus was on data cleaning to ensure consistency, remove any corrupt or incomplete records, and prepare the dataset for downstream processing. This involved checking for missing values, correcting formatting issues, and standardizing data entries. By the end of the session, we successfully cleaned the dataset, making it fully ready for the next critical phase: feature extraction. This step sets the foundation for accurate and effective model training in the coming stages.

    Today wasn’t a bad day overall. We officially started working with the new dataset, which marks a fresh chapter in our project. Although it’s a necessary step forward, I can’t help but feel a bit down knowing that, in some ways, we’re going back to square one. After all the effort we put into the previous data and the progress we thought we had made, it feels like we’re starting from the beginning again. That said, I know this shift was the right decision for the accuracy and quality of our results, and I’m trying to remind myself that restarting isn’t failure—it’s refinement. Hopefully, this new direction will lead to stronger outcomes and a more successful model in the end.
