what_i_learned: |
  Today at my internship, most of our focus was on preparing for the upcoming research presentation. The atmosphere was a mix of anticipation and final-touch urgency. We spent time reviewing the content we’ve worked on over the past several weeks—double-checking our methods, results, and insights to make sure everything is clearly communicated and easy to follow.I helped refine the slide deck, ensuring that each section had a logical flow and that the visuals matched our message. There was a lot of back-and-forth discussion with team members about what to include, what to simplify, and how to best showcase our model performance, especially the parts involving denoising, class balancing, and multimodal fusion. We also did a run-through of the presentation to catch any gaps or awkward transitions. I got feedback on how I explained some of the methods, which helped me rephrase a few technical parts into more understandable terms for a general audience. Overall, today was all about tightening our message and polishing the story of our work. It felt good to look back and realize how far the project has come — and now it’s almost time to present it.

reflection: |
  Today was a pivotal moment in my internship journey — we focused entirely on preparing for our final presentation. As I reflect on the day, I realize how much weight a single presentation can carry in showcasing weeks of effort, learning, and iteration. The process started with revisiting all the work we’ve done: the denoising pipelines, the class balancing strategies, the architectural tuning, and our noise robustness experiments. As I helped shape the presentation slides, I found myself needing to step back and think not just like a researcher, but like a storyteller. How do we explain this in a way that makes sense to someone unfamiliar with our journey? How do we make the results speak for themselves? One challenge I faced was simplifying complex model processes — like the multimodal fusion and the differences between 1D and 2D CNNs — without watering down their significance. It forced me to evaluate how well I truly understand what we’ve built. It’s one thing to code it or see the accuracy score go up; it’s another to explain why it worked. What stood out to me the most was how collaborative the process was. Everyone had input — not just on the slides, but on how we tell the story. That taught me something important: technical work doesn’t stand alone. Presentation, clarity, and delivery matter just as much. As we rehearsed, I noticed areas where my explanation faltered or lacked confidence. That’s something I want to work on — being able to articulate technical decisions with clarity and composure under pressure. In all, today reminded me that reflection isn't just a solo act — it's something that grows stronger when shared. Preparing for this presentation helped me connect the dots between what we did and why it matters, both to me and to others.
