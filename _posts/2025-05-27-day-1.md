what_i_learned: |
  Today i learned what git and github was. It was a cool session, I also learnt different git commands like git pull, git push, and also commit commands. I also met with my different project partners, the people I will be working with this summer. We also did a placement test and also a speed networking bingo. The speed netwroking bingo was stressful but i got it done ad the placemnt test was also in python.

  It was exciting to start the internship and finally meet new people finally. I also learnt something new in the aspect of git and GitHub. I learned what 'commit' means and how it differs from 'git push'.Overall, it was a good first day, i got to meet new people and learn new things.
