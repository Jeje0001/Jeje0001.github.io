what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt about reading, writing, and appending to files using python. I also learnt more about machine learning through computer vision. That was a fun session. We also did an escape room. We also learnt new technologies, one of them is called computer vision.

blockers: |
  No Blockers.
reflection: |
  Today was good, I learnt new things like computer vision, reading, writing, and appending to files using python. I also built a deeper connection with my project partners with the escape room game, although it was really difficult. Today was decently fun.
