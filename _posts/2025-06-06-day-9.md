   Today wasnt that eventful. We reviewed the code for the denoising we wrote yesterday. After we started working on the slides for the presentation. Then when we were done with the slides we started working on the presentation on zoom

reflection: |
  Today was calm. I think it was calm because it was a Friday. I mostly just worked on the presentations and taking note on the changes i have to make to my code.
