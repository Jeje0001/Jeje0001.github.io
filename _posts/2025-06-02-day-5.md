what_i_learned: |
  I met with my faculty mentor and graduate mentor for my project in person. We started off the day with a meeting with the officials of the program, and then we took a picture, and then we worked with our teammates to create the tallest building with marshmallows. Then, after we got a lecture on machine learning and how it works. Then after i went to the lab section where the research professor talked in deatil about the project. This helped me understand the project more in detail and understand what we are going to do.

  No Blockers.
reflection: |
  Today wasnt bad, but the lunch time needs to be longer. It's too short, and with the time, I can't get enough done. But overall,l learning more about the project was good, now I know what I need to do to achieve.
