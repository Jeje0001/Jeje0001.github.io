what_i_learned: |
   Today, I dove into learning OpenCV, which was crucial for the task of denoising images. It was definitely one of the tougher challenges I've faced so far. I think today marks the first time I've really encountered a significant blocker. The process of denoising the images wasn’t easy at all—it felt like I was stuck at times, unsure of how to proceed. But despite the struggle, I pushed through and figured it out. It took a lot of patience and persistence, but getting past this challenge felt really rewarding. I now feel more confident in applying OpenCV to my projects, even though it was a steep learning curve.

  I would say the only blocker i faced was denoiseing the images.
reflection: |
  Today was alright, though it wasn’t without its challenges. The denoising task was particularly tough, and I struggled with it for a while. But in the end, I managed to get it done, which was a huge relief. Tomorrow looks like it will be an interesting day. We’ve got reflections and presentations planned, which should be a good opportunity to share what we’ve been working on and learn from others. On top of that, we’ll continue working on the filter, which I’m hoping will go a bit more smoothly than today. Overall, I feel optimistic that tomorrow will be a better day than today, and I’m excited to make progress.
