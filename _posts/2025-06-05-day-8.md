what_i_learned: |
   Today i learned opencv. Opencv was neccessary for denosing the image. It was really diffcult i think today is the first day that i had an actual blocker. It was diffcult for me to denoise the images but i still got it done.

 

blockers: |
  I would say the only blocker i faced was denoiseing the images.
reflection: |
  Today was alright. But denoiseing was really diffcult. But i got it done. Tommorrow we are also doing the relfections and presentations and also working on the filter tommorrow. I think tommorrow should be better than today
