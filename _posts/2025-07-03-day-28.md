 Today marked a major milestone in my internship journey  our project presentation day. I had the opportunity to present several key slides from our team’s work, including the Project Summary, Expected Outcomes, Progress Update, Preliminary Data Findings, and two demos showcasing our results from both datasets. During my presentation, I explained the core goal of our ECGNet system, walked through our data pipeline, and discussed how we trained deep learning models like the 1D CNN and 1D CNN + Transformer. I also explained the significance of our confusion matrix and how we measured model performance using time and frequency domain inputs. I felt nervous initially, but once I started speaking, I gained confidence and was able to clearly communicate our progress and challenges. Presenting today helped me realize how far we’ve come as a team  from raw ECG data to building working AI models with meaningful clinical potential. It was a proud and reflective moment, and I’m looking forward to what we achieve next.

   Today was a major turning point in my internship — presentation day. After weeks of data cleaning, model development, and iteration, I finally had the chance to stand in front of the team and present our project, ECGNet. I was responsible for several key parts of the presentation: the project summary, expected outcomes, progress update, preliminary findings, and the demo results from our two datasets. Preparing for these slides pushed me to really understand the work we’ve done — not just technically, but also in terms of impact.  
When the moment came to speak, I felt nervous. My heart was racing and for a brief second, I worried I might forget something. But once I started, the words began to flow. Explaining how we used time-domain and frequency-domain data, why we chose 1D CNNs and Transformers, and how we evaluated our models with confusion matrices helped me realize how much I’ve actually learned. I even answered some challenging questions. Looking back, today was more than just a presentation. It was a reflection of growth, both technical and personal. I communicated complex ideas to an audience, handled nerves, and proved to myself that I belong in this space.
