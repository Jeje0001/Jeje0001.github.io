what_i_learned: |
 Today marked a major milestone in my internship journey  our project presentation day. I had the opportunity to present several key slides from our team’s work, including the Project Summary, Expected Outcomes, Progress Update, Preliminary Data Findings, and two demos showcasing our results from both datasets. During my presentation, I explained the core goal of our ECGNet system, walked through our data pipeline, and discussed how we trained deep learning models like the 1D CNN and 1D CNN + Transformer. I also explained the significance of our confusion matrix and how we measured model performance using time and frequency domain inputs. I felt nervous initially, but once I started speaking, I gained confidence and was able to clearly communicate our progress and challenges. Presenting today helped me realize how far we’ve come as a team  from raw ECG data to building working AI models with meaningful clinical potential. It was a proud and reflective moment, and I’m looking forward to what we achieve next.
