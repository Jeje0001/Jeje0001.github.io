  Today, we set the strategies for achieving our goals for this week. The day started with a meeting with our faculty mentor. He reviewed our work from last week and provided feedback on areas where we can improve. He also outlined the key goals for this week and shared a step-by-step plan on how we can achieve them effectively. His guidance was really helpful in clarifying the expectations and giving us a clear direction for the week ahead.After the meeting, I shifted my focus to the technical side of our project. I started working on creating a new database to store the data that we have extracted from the denoising and filtering step. This database is crucial for organizing and managing the processed ECG data so that we can easily retrieve and analyze it later. I designed the database structure to include essential fields such as the sample ID, strip ID, label, and relevant metadata, which will help us track and manage the data efficiently. I also made sure to implement proper indexing so that queries can be run smoothly and data retrieval will be quick. Tomorrow, I plan to continue this work by writing scripts to extract important information from this database, such as specific ECG signal characteristics or patient-related metadata that will support further analysis and modeling. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into this data and uncovering insights that will contribute to the success of our project. Overall, today was productive and set a strong foundation for the rest of the week.

  Today was good. We started off the day with a review of what we’ve accomplished so far, and we also spent some time setting goals for the upcoming week. Our faculty mentor emphasized the importance of working efficiently and divided us into small groups so that we could focus on different aspects of the project and achieve our goals faster. I really appreciated how the mentor explained the tasks and provided guidance on how to collaborate effectively. Being in a group setting made me realize how valuable teamwork is, especially in a fast-paced learning environment like this. It also gave me an opportunity to learn from my peers, share ideas, and pick up new techniques that I might not have discovered on my own.I feel like this week is going to be particularly productive and full of new learning opportunities. I’m excited about the potential to add more practical skills to my resume, and I’m confident that the work we’re doing here will make me a stronger candidate for future internships and job opportunities. Overall, I’m feeling motivated and eager to tackle the challenges ahead.
