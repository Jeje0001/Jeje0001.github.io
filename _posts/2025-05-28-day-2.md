what_i_learned: |
  Today i met with my facultly and my faculty mentor. He told us the things we should learn before we get to campus on monday. After that we lstrated on python 102. We learnt about dictionaries and sets. I learnt that dictionaries use key value pairs and sets dont allow duplicate values. Today we also played a game where people had to guess a animal or item assigned to them.

reflection: |
 Today was more busy than yesterday. From today i also know what the expectations the faculty members have for us. I also understand more about the project i am working on and the things i need to do to make it successful.
