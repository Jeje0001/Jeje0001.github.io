 Today, I continued refining our research paper draft, with a particular focus on formatting and organization within Overleaf. I worked on structuring the results and discussion sections clearly, ensuring that the figures, tables, and accompanying explanations followed a logical and professional academic flow. I also revised table captions and titles to improve clarity and consistency across the document. In addition to the Overleaf work, I reviewed and updated the results visuals, selecting the most representative performance images for each model variant we tested. This included sorting through different performance charts and making sure the chosen images accurately captured our key findings, particularly in noise robustness and model comparison. I also did a round of proofreading to improve the readability of the draft and prepared notes for tomorrow’s meeting, where I plan to walk through the suggested edits and remaining gaps before the final submission.

reflection: |
  Today’s work reminded me that research isn't just about building models or crunching numbers — it’s also about how we communicate the work. I spent most of the day refining our Overleaf paper, and it felt like stepping into a new role: not just as a researcher, but as a storyteller of our results. I focused on tightening the structure of the results and discussion sections, making sure each part flowed logically and clearly. I paid special attention to the tables and figures — not just what to include, but how to title them, where to place them, and how to ensure they actually enhanced understanding rather than just filled space. That part taught me that visual clarity is just as important as analytical depth. One of the more challenging but rewarding tasks was selecting the best images to represent our models’ performances. I had to ask myself: Which graphs actually speak? Which visuals show what we want others to see, without needing extra words? It took longer than I expected, but in the end, I’m proud of the selections. Today also made me realize how much I’ve grown in balancing technical accuracy with clarity, and how many little details go into turning good work into publishable work. I still have more to do, but each revision brings the paper closer to what it needs to be.
