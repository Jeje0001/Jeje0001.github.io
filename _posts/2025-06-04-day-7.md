what_i_learned: |
   We started off the day the same we started off yesterday setting our goals for the day. Our goal today was to be able to list the images and also crop out non important imformation from the ecg images. I was able to get that done and then i started learning the libaries we will need for the denoising tomorrow. Denoising basically means removing unnecessary data or blurred images from the dataset because we dont want to train the ai models we are going to create with bad data. The libaries i learnt are opencv,pandas and scikit learn.

 

blockers: |
  I would say the only blocker i faced was walking from the research lab to mcdonalds. By the time i got back to my research lab i was already tired because the work was really long.
reflection: |
  Today was really good. I sat down during the break and i began to think about how good my resume would look by the time i am done with this internship. I might be able to land a faang internship because i am learning so many new things and by the end of this internship my knowledge of computer programming would be on a different level. By the end of this internship can you belive that i would have created and trained 3 ai models. By the time i am done with this i will be on a different level. I can't wait.
