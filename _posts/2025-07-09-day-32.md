  Today’s internship activities were a balanced mix of technical work and personal growth. The morning and early afternoon were focused on continuing progress on the ECG project. I spent time refining our existing models and analyzing previous experiment results to identify areas for optimization. We also discussed plans for integrating insights from the frequency-domain models into the upcoming 2D CNN spectrogram pipeline. A special highlight of the day was our team building exercise, led by  our high school teacher who joined us for the session. It was a refreshing break from the usual technical grind and a great opportunity to reflect, laugh, and bond as a group. The session included interactive games, storytelling, and honest conversations about teamwork, leadership, and growth—both professionally and personally. It reminded us that collaboration and connection are just as important as code and models. Overall, it was a wholesome day that balanced productivity with reflection and relationship-building—key ingredients for a successful research journey.

  Today reminded me that growth during an internship isn’t just about building better models — it’s also about building better people and better teams. The technical part of my day was steady. I continued working on the ECG project, reviewing the performance of our models and thinking critically about where improvements could be made. It wasn’t one of those flashy, breakthrough days, but the quiet, consistent work felt necessary — like laying bricks for something larger. There’s value in that. But what really stood out today was something less expected: a team building exercise with our  high school teacher. It was such a unique experience to step away from our screens and reconnect on a more human level. There was something grounding about hearing stories from someone who taught us long before we got into deep learning or ECG signals. It brought perspective — a reminder of how far we've come, and how the relationships we’ve built along the way still shape who we are. The exercise itself was lighthearted, but beneath the surface, it was about trust, communication, and vulnerability. It made me think about how important it is to invest not just in my skills, but in my ability to connect and collaborate with others — especially in fields that demand both technical precision and teamwork.
